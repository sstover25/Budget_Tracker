# NoSQL Challenge: Social Network API

## Description

```
The client requested a PWA budget tracker that can be used  while traveling
and with limited to no online connectivity. The requirements are to use
indexedDB, a service worker, a web manifest, and that it must be deployed on Heroku.
```

## User Story

```
AS AN avid traveler
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling

```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
- It is done when the user inputs an expense or deposit and then receives a notification
that they have added an expense or deposit.

- It is done when the user reestablishes an internet connection, and then the deposits
or expenses added while they were offline are added to their transaction history and
their totals are updated.
```
